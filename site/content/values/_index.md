      When it comes to Fur Storage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. During the hot summer months, keeping your Fur at home is a costly mistake even in a cedar closet is not recommended because the wood absorbs moisture which can and will dry out your Fur. Furs should NEVER be stored with moth balls. Moth balls react to moisture in the air to produce a gas that acts as fumigant. The chemical reaction can cause irreparable damage to your fur not to mention the lingering odor.
